# Brownie-s-Honey-Ecommerce
This is my first ever HTML/CSS project in completion of HTML and CSS programming class. 
This project used real-time products and description based on Arctic Honey Finland´s webpage. 
The idea of this project was to practice the basics of HTML and CSS, as well as practice UI Design using Figma. 
Making this project inspired me to develop my skills in UI Design :)
If you happen to see this, please don´t hesitate to put in your comments. I would appreciate it. :)
