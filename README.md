# 🍯 Brownie's Honey Ecommerce

Welcome to my very first HTML & CSS adventure—a sweet e-commerce showcase inspired by the real products of Arctic Honey Finland! 
DISCLAIMER: I made this 3 years ago so it might be outdated and some photos might not be available anymore. 

🌟 **What’s inside?**
- A beautiful, hand-coded online store—crafted from scratch with pure HTML and CSS.
- Real product descriptions and images, all styled for a delightful browsing experience.
- UI design concepts brought to life with Figma.

💡 **Why I built this:**  
This project was born as my capstone for an HTML and CSS programming class. It’s not just code—it’s my journey into web development and UI design, and I loved every minute of it!
